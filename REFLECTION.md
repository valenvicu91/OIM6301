Before this project, I had a very basic idea of what a database was, but I had never gone through the full process of creating one from start to finish. Through this assignment, I learned how relational modeling and SQL really come together to organize and analyze information in a structured way. Starting with the Babson Bean Café scenario, I created an Entity Relationship Diagram that mapped how customers, baristas, products, and orders all connect. At first, it was challenging to understand how relationships worked, especially the many-to-many ones, but once I learned about junction tables like Order_Line_Item, everything started to make sense. I realized that a good design makes queries much easier to write later on.

When I started writing the SQL queries, I finally saw how powerful structured data can be. I practiced filtering, aggregating, joining tables, and even ranking results to answer business questions. What I enjoyed most was seeing how each query told a story about the café’s operations—like which customers spent the most, or which promotions performed best.

AI helped me a lot throughout the process. I used it to check my table structures, fix syntax errors, and format my queries neatly. Some prompts I used were: “Help me design an ERD for a café,” “walk me through the process of creating the tables in dbeaver” and “Write SQL queries based on these business questions.” I always validated the outputs by running them in DBeaver to see if they worked and made sense with my data.

There were moments when AI’s suggestions didn’t fully match my dataset. For example, one query using strftime() gave null results because my dates weren’t formatted correctly, so I simplified it using SUBSTR(). Another time, AI listed the wrong import order for my tables, which I fixed by starting with parent tables first.

If I did this project again, I would plan my data earlier and test small samples before building the full schema. Overall, this project really helped me connect what we learned in class with real database work, and I feel much more confident using SQL now.
